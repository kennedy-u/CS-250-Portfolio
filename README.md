## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To get a good interpretation of users’ needs the team would start with system analysis. This can be done by asking for feedback from the old users and covering that feedback when modifying the source code. The specific inputs and outputs for the system should be identified and refined.

A user story is a wonderful way to express users' needs. It is a tool that is used mostly in Agile development that can help understand the perspective of the end-user. It helps in understanding what the users' want.

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Developing programs can be approached by various project management strategies. Waterfall methodology is one such strategy. Waterfall helps in projecting the needs and adopting specific strategies. Other approaches are iterative, prototyping, agile, and incremental approaches.

The most common and popular agile processes that should be included are Crystal, Scrum, Extreme Programming, etc. These approaches and processes offer unique ways to work with testing, planning, and integration.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member follows the team standards and project styles in the coding and design process. It is important to maintain a sense of progress in the team. All aspects of the project development should be considered. One should also react in a friendly way and own up to one's responsibilities.
